# Notes for the readme on how we used and modify the db

## Image Database

The folder ImageDB is the whole db of images and the scripts to modify the db to have something that fits to our needs for the project

## User Database

Got the users from https://randomuser.me/
I then convert them to a format that fits my needs to the user DB of the project with the script formatBotUsers.js
